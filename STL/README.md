# STL Files for 3D Printing

This directory contains STL files for 3D printing the components of the Theo Jansen Rhinoceros kinetic sculpture.

## Files

Place your `.stl` files here for each component that needs to be 3D printed.

## Printing Guidelines

- Recommended layer height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 20-30% for most parts
- Supports: May be needed for some parts
- Material: PLA or PETG recommended

## Assembly

Refer to the main documentation for assembly instructions and how these parts fit together.

## Notes

- STL files are provided for educational and non-commercial purposes
- Test print one component first to verify scale and fit
