## About This Project

This repository documents my journey of creating a kinetic sculpture inspired by the brilliant work of Dutch artist **Theo Jansen** and his Strandbeest creations. The Strandbeest (meaning "beach beast" in Dutch) are kinetic sculptures that walk on wind power, demonstrating an elegant fusion of art, engineering, and nature.

### Purpose

- **Educational**: Share the learning process of designing and building kinetic sculptures
- **Inspire Children**: Help young learners explore the intersection of engineering, art, and mechanics
- **Non-Commercial**: This project is created purely for educational purposes
- **Open Source**: All design files and documentation are freely available

### Attribution and Respect

This project is deeply inspired by Theo Jansen's original Strandbeest mechanisms. I have tremendous respect for his innovative work and artistic vision. This project:

- Is **NOT** an exact replica of Theo Jansen's designs
- Serves as a learning tool to understand kinetic mechanisms
- Is shared for **educational and non-commercial purposes only**
- Encourages others to study and appreciate Theo Jansen's original works

**Please visit [Theo Jansen's official website](https://www.strandbeest.com/) to learn about his amazing creations.**
